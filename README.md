# GUESSTHEWORD
Being a fresh SEI Bootcamp student, I've been asked to build a game for my first project. I had to choose A game from a list of games, sorted from the easiest to the hardest. Being without any coding experience, I picked the easiest one. I wanted a soft start and to get the feeling of accomplishment. 

Soâ€¦ I pIcked the "HANGMAN GAME."
BUT I didn't want to hang anyone, so I changed it to make it positive, funny and fun.
A prize is presented to the player as a picture.
If you are correct and guess the secret word's missing letters, you will win the prize. As you make mistakes, the prize's picture fades away as if getting further and further away, until it is completely faded if you lose. 

My code is not fully DRY, and I believe I could write it in a better way. I assume that three weeks from now, I will laugh. 
However, for now, I'm proud of myself. The main things that I learned were DOM, FUNCTION, LOOP and CSS. It took me a lot of time to design the elements with flex and grid. 
The code has two areas. One for the prize-picture
And the other section is for the secret word, hint and data about whether you've succeeded or not.

I'll be happy to read your thoughts.
And remember - it is my first project, be gentle :)
Thank you very much.
